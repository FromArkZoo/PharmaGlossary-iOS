"""Append compound medical terms to glossary.json.

These are high-frequency phrases that appear in existing entry detail text
(disease subtypes, cell types, trial phases, treatment modalities) but lack
their own entries — so the linker either grabs a misleading substring (e.g.
"cell" inside "non-small-cell lung cancer") or leaves the phrase unlinked.
Adding them as standalone entries lets the existing longest-match-wins linker
do the right thing.

Idempotent: skips entries whose `term` already exists (case-insensitive match).
Sorts the final list by (letter asc, term asc) for stable output.
